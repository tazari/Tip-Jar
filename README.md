# Pre-work - *Tip Jar*

**Tip Jar** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Tanya Azari**

Time spent: **7** days spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Split bill into equal amounts for parties of 2 or more
- [x] Splash page for loading

## Notes

I had to dig through may a StackOverflow page to resolve the issues I ran into, most being errors with XCode/ the files themselves, some being errors with the code (as I am new to Swift). 
It seems like there was an error at each step--even for recording the gif! Neither QuickTime Screen Recording nor the reccommended RecordIt would capture the Simulator (the whole screen would go black).

The final two errors--and the only ones I wasn't able to resolve--were in pushing from XCode to GitHub and recording a fully-functional gif. I ended up manually uploading the files via GitHub due to several unresolveable error messages, and recording a gif that did not include all of the app's funcitonality (as XCode kept terminating the program when I would try to change the tip percentage or input an amount on the Main storyboard).

Otherwise, it was a pretty smooth process and an enjoyable learning experience.
